# Implement an app with React :bulb:

In this project we will build our pocket movie app in which we will keep track of our favorite movies and set up a watch later list. We will use the ReactJs knowledge that you accumulated in previous projects to build the interface and show data from an API.

## Learning Objectives: :brain:

- Manage state and props in a react component
- Use React hooks to achieve certain behavior
- Implement a design with JSX and CSS (React)
- Implement a frontend app with React

## Requirements: :white_check_mark:

- Class components are not allowed
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Try to use ES6 features
